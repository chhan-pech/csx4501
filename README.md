## Profile
### 
I'm Chhandara ("Chhan") from Los Angeles and a current student in **UCLA CSX 450-1: Introduction to Data Science**. I work as a research staff at UCLA where I work with data and spatial analysis to analyze patterns of inequity across neighborhoods in the areas of housing, transporation, and sustainability. I have a Master's Degree in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA. 
## Course Description
### 
UCLA CSX 450-1 introduces students to the evolving domain of data science and the food chain of knowledge domains involved in its application. Students learn a wide range of challenges, questions, and problems that data science helps address in different domains, including social sciences, finance, health and fitness, and entertainment. The course addresses the key knowledge domains in data science, including data development and management, machine learning and natural language processing, statistical analysis, data visualization, and inference. The course includes case studies that require students to work on real-life data science problems.
## Project Ideas
### 
At the moment, I am unsure about what final project I'll like to work on for the class. I would like to hear more about what is required for the final project but 
I hope to work on a project that overlaps with some existing projects that I am doing at my current job ("kill two birds with one stone") and applying the skills I've learned from the class. 
## Objectives
###
My key objectives for this course include:
- Acquire a better understanding of the data science field and its role in decision making.
- Gain fluency in basic programming skills in Python and R with a focus on data analysis, statistical modeling and machine learning.
- Learn and use Tableau to analyze data and information to visually display results and findings that effectively communicates to the general audience.
- Apply the knowledge and skills learned in this course to projects that I am working on my current job.
